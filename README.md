A creative dashboard of netflix shows analyasis
To build this dashboard, I used Microsoft Excel for cleaning the dataset. The raw data had missing values and unstructured columns, so I formatted the columns, removed null entries, and made it ready for Tableau. After that, I used Tableau Desktop to connect the data and create multiple charts to visualize it in an engaging and interactive format.

In the dashboard, I added several filters that let users choose the type of content (Movie or TV Show), the title, and the year it was added. I also included a world map that shows the total number of titles from each country. The donut chart displays the distribution of content between Movies and TV Shows. The bar charts show the most popular genres and the ratings distribution. There's also a line/area chart that shows how the number of titles added to Netflix has changed over the years. Additionally, a dynamic description box appears when selecting a title, giving detailed information about that specific show or movie.
